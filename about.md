Hi, my name is Edward L Richards, though I often go by Ned. I am a graduate
student at [Scripps Insitution of Oceanography](http://scripps.ucsd.edu) in
La Jolla, California. My research focuses on acoustics in the ocean, basically
the sounds that can be heard underwater (if we had the right kind of ears for
hearing underwater).
